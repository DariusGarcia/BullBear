# BullBear

#### BullBear is a MERN stack web app that lets users add stocks from the S&P500 index to their own personal watch list.

## Description
I decided to build this web app since I enjoy investing and reading up on stocks, and what better way to keep track of my stocks than to build out my own stock tracking application. I got the inspiration for the name 'BullBear' because I realized that stocks go up and down; It's never a straight line. I think this applies to life, such that the best way to progress is to push through your failures and to ride the ups and downs of life.
